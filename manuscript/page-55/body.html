Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald "brought in upon a platter,") 

I am no prophetâ€”and here's no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.

After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
Would it have been worth</pre></div> </div>
